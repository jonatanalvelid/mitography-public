Scripts used in the analysis of mitochondria and the actin cytoskeleton in super-resolved STED nanoscopy and confocal images of neurons. 
The code is divided by the various programming/scripting languages used: ImageJ, MATLAB, and Python, and the various experiments they are used to analyse.
Example data for all analysis scripts are provided in the separate folder.
Please see info.txt for information about the various scripts.
